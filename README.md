# Project background

SkyReach Retail, a mid-sized e-commerce brand, runs multiple seasonal digital marketing campaigns across email, social media, and paid ads. With rising advertising costs and increasing competition, management needed clarity on which campaigns drive the highest engagement, conversion, and revenue, and where marketing spend is being under-utilized.

I collaborated with the marketing strategy lead to analyze campaign performance data, identify key drivers of customer conversion, and uncover improvement opportunities. The goal was to detect underperforming segments, and deliver data-driven recommendations to optimize targeting, reduce spend inefficiencies, and improve overall campaign effectiveness.
